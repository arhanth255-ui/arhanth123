Developer interested in Python, JavaScript, and systems programming. I enjoy prototyping ideas in Python, experimenting with OS internals, and learning how kernels and low-level systems operate. Most of my work here is exploratory, experimental, and focused on learning. More projects and experiments coming soon.
